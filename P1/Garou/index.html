					<h2>Deny Both Good and Evil</h2>
					<p>Garou (ガロウ, Garō; Viz: Garo) is a villain, a martial arts prodigy, the self-proclaimed "Hero Hunter," and a major adversary of the Hero Association and Monster Association. He is a disciple of Bang and was once expelled from his dojo for going on a rampage.[9] Because of his fascination with monsters, he is commonly called the "Human Monster."[10][11] Sitch of the Hero Association views him as a grave threat to the organization despite being only a human.[12][13]

					After the Monster Association incident, Garou is currently being rehabilitated under Bang, who has retired from being a hero and is intending for Garou to fill the hole he has left.[14] </p>

						<h3>Limit Breaker</h3>

						<p>Platinum Sperm and Flashy Flash charge towards Garou, who then jumps up high, causing the other two to cross blows against each other. To their surprise, Garou quickly jumps downwards them with a mighty double kick, with Flashy Flash and Platinum Sperm dodging and the ground being broken apart along with sending many rubbles flying due to Garou's stomp. As many rubbles are floating in the air, the three of them begin exchanging blows at incredible speeds, while using the rocks as platforms.

						The fight is happening so fast that a geometric structure of light is created from the speed of their fight. Flashy Flash charges at Garou but is quickly knocked back by the latter. Platinum Sperm instantly uses his tentacle to restrain Flashy Flash, holding him still by wrapping it around his neck and striking him repeatedly, causing the hero to spit blood. Flashy Flash tries to counter with his Wind Blade Kick but Platinum Sperm manages to dodge his attack. Platinum Sperm then suggests Garou team up with him to defeat Flashy Flash, pointing out that the hero's been weakened due to losing his sword and saying that they can have a one-on-one battle immediately after beating him. As Garou pretends to agree with him, Platinum Sperm lets his guard down and is punched in the face by the Hero Hunter, much to his anger. While their fight continues, Garou begins to showcase his Monster Calamity God Slayer Fist, and momentarily repels both him and Flashy Flash. </p>

				<h2>Just a little more to add</h2>

					<p>Garou is initially presented as a sinister villain, obsessed with becoming a monster and beating up heroes. He can come off being quite brutal as he is willing to attack those that are weaker than him and demonstrate painful techniques such as twisting their arms and muscles. He can also be very prideful of his strength and skill, which in turn leads him to his eventual downfall.

					Because of his past where he was subjected to bullying, Garou despises popularity, believing that those that are popular will always win. In addition to this, he dislikes how villains are always forced to be the ones to lose, while the heroes are the ones that always win. This has led to him developing his hatred towards heroes and why he goes about beating up heroes.

					Despite his ruthless nature, Garou does actually have a sense of morality in him. He does not actually aim to kill heroes or even attack civilians. Instead, he simply wishes to beat up heroes in a punishing fashion. He is also shown to be quite protective for others, despite being in denial about it. This is noticeably shown in his relationship with Tareo, who looks up to him as a guardian. Tareo was considered as his only connection to his own humanity. It's also for this reason why he dislikes the Monster Association and refuses to affiliate himself with them as the Monster Association truly desires to bring nothing but harm and destruction upon humanity.

					As Garou gradually mutates through the course of the series, he slowly becomes more and more gigantic and monstrous-like, ending up developing a feral and animal-like mind. He remains silent but still retains his brutal, merciless nature when fighting monsters. He desires to bring "world peace" in the sense that he wishes to become the absolute evil monster for the heroes to stand and unite against, as everyone will have a common foe for them to face, thus ending any kind of conflict amongst each other
